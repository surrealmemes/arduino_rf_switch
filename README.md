Many vendor and product IDs have been included. Should work with most Arduino boards.

Flash the .ino file found in the "rfswitch_arduino_firmware" folder to the Arduino. Plug in the Arduino USB to your PC after wiring it to the RF switch as shown in the diagram. Execute "arduino-rf-switch.exe" and you should be able to select your desired port.
